Introduces iron ore while staying true to the vanilla Rimworld core values. Instead of steel around your map, you will spawn with mineable iron ore! Forge the iron down in a smithy along with some coal or charcoal, and turn it into the much better material: steel!

This does increase the production time to get steel a little bit, but it's not as much as other mods have done previously. It won't be a huge burden on your production chain, and is mostly just an aesthetic change to the world.

Add it to a save. It should work fine, because the changes to mineable steel are cosmetic. If you uninstall the mod it will also work fine, and revert back perfectly. Be sure you remove the recipes from your smithies before you do.

[h1]How this works[/h1]

Minable steel won't change except in name, and the fact that it will now drop iron ore (not steel.) This means all mods that change compacted steel deposits are compatible with Vanilla Iron and Steel.

Steel also won't change, except in graphic. It's the same steel you've always been using, and so mods that adjust it will work perfectly.

Turn coal (or charcoal) and iron into steel in a smithy. I keep a vanilla balance, meaning it won't take forever to make the steel. It will take a little extra time and a tiny bit of coal or charcoal to get steel, but the aesthetic improvements are worth it in my opinion.


You require a coal mod for Vanilla Iron and Steel to function correctly. There's many to choose from.
